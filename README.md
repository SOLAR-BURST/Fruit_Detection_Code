# Fruit_Detection_Code

Fruits detection using color segmentation method in Matlab (Computer Vision) Code to detect plot different fruits in 1 picture. You can run the code with the picture "fruits.jpg", make sure you have the 2 files in the same directory. Feel free to suggest new versions of the code and new functionalities.

## Prerequisites
MATLAB installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/SOLAR-BURST/Fruit_Detection_Code.git
~~~

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the main script file fruit_segmentation.m in MATLAB.

4. Modify the input image file path if needed.

~~~bash
im_IN = imread('path/to/your/image.jpg');
~~~


5. Run the script by clicking the "Run" button in MATLAB or entering fruit_segmentation in the MATLAB command window.
